Flora is a basic NFT marketplace aimed at creating digital flower collectibles. Any user is capable of creating a flower NFT and choose to keep it for themselves or sell it in the public marketplace. Users also have the ability to gift their NFTs to other users of the platform,  which makes sure that anyone can have a flower. All this was built on the celo blockchain and thereby only celo addresses apply
